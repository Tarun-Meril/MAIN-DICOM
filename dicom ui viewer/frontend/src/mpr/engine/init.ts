/**
 * MPR engine bootstrap.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this module deliberately does NOT initialise Cornerstone.
 *
 * The host application owns engine setup in `src/initCornerstone.ts`, and that
 * setup is not generic: it registers a custom JPEG 2000 decode worker with
 * `{ overwrite: true }`, installs `wadoImageLoaderWithFallback` for the
 * wadouri / dicomfile / wadors / cornerstoneStreamingImageVolume schemes, and
 * configures the streaming volume loader.
 *
 * An earlier version of this file called `coreInit()`, `toolsInit()` and
 * `dicomImageLoader.init()` again when MPR opened. In Cornerstone v4 a second
 * `dicomImageLoader.init()` REPLACES the worker registration, which discarded
 * the host's JPEG 2000 decoder. Every image in a JPEG 2000 study (transfer
 * syntax 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90 — which is what this PACS sends) then failed to
 * decode and both the 2D viewer and MPR rendered flat grey.
 *
 * So MPR now only:
 *   1. waits for the host's initialisation to finish, and
 *   2. installs its own metadata provider, which is additive and safe.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the decoder, the image loaders or the volume loaders.
