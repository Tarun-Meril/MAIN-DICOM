# PACS Study Browser

A standalone, self-contained PACS Study Browser application designed for study management, querying, importing, and exporting DICOM studies. This application is completely decoupled from the MedView PRO DICOM Viewer, allowing independent development and deployment, while maintaining seamless integration through URL-based launching.

## Key Features

- **PACS Archive**: Complete study listing with expandable nested rows displaying series details.
- **Query & Filters**: Advanced search by Patient Name, Patient ID, Accession Number, Modalities, and Study Date/Range.
- **DICOM Import**: Drag-and-drop or file upload zone for importing local `.dcm` files with automatic metadata extraction.
- **DICOM Export**: Option to download raw DICOM instance files directly.
- **Viewer Integration**: A "View" action that launches the MedView PRO DICOM Viewer in a separate browser tab using the study's unique identifier.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm (version 9 or higher)

### Installation

To install all dependencies for the root, frontend, and backend, run:

```bash
npm run install:all
```

### Running the Application

To run both the frontend and backend concurrently in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch:
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005) (proxying `/api` to the backend)
- **Backend**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Integration with MedView PRO DICOM Viewer

The PACS Study Browser is integrated with the MedView PRO DICOM Viewer via URL routing. When a user clicks the **View** button on a study:
1. The browser opens a new tab to `http://localhost:3000/viewer/{studyInstanceUid}`.
2. The MedView PRO DICOM Viewer (running on port 3000) intercepts the route and loads the study directly from its configured DICOM Web data source.
